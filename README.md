  <h2>Project Background</h2>
  <p> 
  Reach Autism is a small local non-profit organization that aims to support families and children living with autism. They offer play-based support for children up to young adults. They have asked the team to redesign their current website to make it more friendly and attractive. Most importantly, they want users to connect with their mission and make them feel the need for this support. Reach wants to highlight the programs and services they offer and call people to donate their time and money to the cause. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The opportunity given for the design team is a real-world application of software development working with a real business that will exist beyond the scope of this class. The team will explore, in conjunction with Reach, a modern and innovative web design that emphasizes the core of the organization's mission and values.</p>

  <h3>Northstar Customer</h3>
  <p>
  Our <b>Northstar customer</b> are those that would use the services and programs that Reach Autism
  offers. This is mainly directed at families with autistic children. It would be the parents/guardians of these
  children that would visit the site and want to utlize these services and programs.
  </p>


  <h3>Carryover Customer</h3>
  <p>
  The <b>Carryover customer</b> are donors and volunteers. We want them to be called to action - to give money or their time to Reach.
  We want to make it clear that their help is greatly needed and greatly appreciated.

  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>WordPress will be the web-development software used to create the final prototype of the website.</li>
      <li>The design process will follow the fast-feedback cycle. The desginers will be meeting with the clients at regular intervals.
      The clients will present feedback and the designers will have to make changes to meet the client's needs. All designs made
      are not static and will constantly evolve.</li>
      <li>The designers will be using the procesess learned in the class and lab to create their final designs. They will be using
      empathy mapping, affinity diagramming, User Story Map's (USM), lo- and hi-fidelity protoyptying before making the final design.</li>
      <li>All files for the project will be made accessible through this GitHub repository.</li>
    </ul>
      
  <h3>Constraints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The default WordPress engine is very limited in what it can do with respect to special functions and responsiveness. The team will
    research what plugins can be used to compensate. That is also limited since most are not free, and those that are will not have more advanced capabilities.</li>
    <li>The team will use Figma to create their hi-fidelity prototypes.</li>
    <li>The team will use StoriesOnBoard to create their USM.</li>
    <li>The team has a very limited (no) budget.</li>
    <li>The team has to follow the process outlined in the project description.</li>
    <li>The team will design the site according to the client's needs and wants (obvious, but is a constraint and important to be followed).</li>
  </ul>
